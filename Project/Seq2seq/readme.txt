Seq2seq Model
_____________________________________________


1.    In the SourceCode_Baseline folder, there are four files:

- Seq2seq Baseline Chatbot.ipynb
- readme.txt
- requirements.txt
= training_details.json

Step 1: The jupyter notebook "Seq2seq Baseline Chatbot.ipynb" contains the scripts corresponding to the baseline seq2seq model in the report. Download into working directory.
Step 2: The codes in the first two cells were necessary as Google Colab was used. If used on a local machine, proceed to Step 2a. If not, proceed to step 3 from here.
Step 2a: Create a virtual environment with a python version of 3.8.5. After creating a virtual environment, run a conda install of the requirements.txt file ($conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt) to install the dependencies. Proceed to step 3.
Step 3: Download the dataset from the link in (2) below and save it in a folder 'SMS Messages' in the working directory. 
Step 4: Run "Seq2seq Baseline Chatbot.ipynb" in jupyter notebook.
